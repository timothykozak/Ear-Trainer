How the Piano Sounds Were Made

The piano samples were downloaded from http://theremin.music.uiowa.edu/MISpiano.html.
Only the ff samples were used.  These aiff samples were imported one at a time,
modified and then exported as an MP3 with the default settings.

There was a wide variation with the lead in and the tailing of each note.
All lead in times have been removed.  Each note was trimmed to a total duration of 5 seconds.

There is a suprising amount of variation in the amplitudes of the samples. Using the regular waveform dB
display, E4 had a maximum of -17db, while Ab4 had a maximum of -7dB.

All of the samples were normalized to -5dB using Effect -> Volume and Compression -> Noramlize after the
entire sample had been selected.

The tails had a fade out effect applied from 2 seconds until 5 seconds using
Effect->Fading->Fade Out.
