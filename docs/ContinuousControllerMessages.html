<p>This MIDI CC list gives an overview of all 127  control change messages and which action they are assigned to by default. You can use this list to set up your MIDI controller and manipulate your MIDI data in all different kind of ways to make your music more expressive. For example, you can use them to add vibrato, abrupt or gradual volume changes, or control the amount of reverb, tremolo, and/or chorus, and so on. The most commonly used CCs are displayed in&nbsp;<strong>bold</strong>&nbsp;typeface.</p>
        <h3>Assign a custom parameter to a MIDI CC</h3>
        <p>If you want to assign a parameter to an undefined CC you find a separate MIDI CC <a style="" href="#undefined">list of all undefined CCs</a> below.</p>
